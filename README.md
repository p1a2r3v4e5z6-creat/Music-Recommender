# Music-Recommender
An intelligent music recommendation system that understands mood, genre, and style using LangChain, ChromaDB, and Gemma 3 embeddings. It analyzes natural-language inputs like “sad chill vibe” or “energetic workout mix” and suggests songs with matching mood and energy from the Spotify Tracks dataset.
